m-LoRA (a.k.a Multi-Lora Fine-Tune) is an open-source framework for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using the efficient multiple LoRA/QLoRA methods. Key features of m-LoRA include:

- Efficient LoRA/QLoRA: Optimizes the fine-tuning process, significantly reducing GPU memory usage by leveraging a shared frozen-based model.

- Multiple LoRA Adapters: Support for concurrent fine-tuning of multiple LoRA/QLoRA adapters.

- LoRA-based Mix-of-Expert LLM Adapter: [MixLoRA](./MixLoRA.md), which implements a Mix-of-Expert architecture based on multiple LoRA adapters for the frozen FFN layer.

## Note from the maintainer of this repository

This is an actively developing fork of the official m-LoRA repository, focusing on LoRA + MoE and its related improvements, maintained by the authors of m-LoRA.

Please note that the functions, interfaces, and performance of this fork are slightly different from the original m-LoRA. We cannot guarantee compatibility. For production use, please prefer the [original m-LoRA](https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/multi-lora-fine-tune).

## Quickstart

Firstly, you should clone this repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/mikecovlee/mlora
cd mlora
# Optional but recommended
conda create -n mlora python=3.10
conda activate mlora
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `mlora.py` code is a starting point for finetuning on various datasets.
Basic command for finetuning a baseline model on the [Alpaca Cleaned](https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned) dataset:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python mlora.py \
  --base_model yahma/llama-7b-hf \
  --config ./config/alpaca.json \
  --load_16bit
```

You can check the template finetune configuration in [template](./template/) folder.

For further detailed usage information, please use `--help` option:
```bash
python mlora.py --help
```

## Model Precision

m-LoRA offers support for various model accuracy and quantization methods. By default, m-LoRA utilizes full precision (Float32), but users can opt for half precision (Float16) using `--fp16` or BrainFloat16 using `--bf16`. Enabling half precision reduces the model size by half, and for further reduction, quantization methods can be employed.

Quantization can be activated using `--load_4bit` for 4-bit quantization or `--load_8bit` for 8-bit quantization. However, when only quantization is enabled, m-LoRA utilizes Float32 for calculations. To achieve memory savings during training, users can combine quantization and half-precision modes.

It's crucial to note that regardless of the settings, **LoRA weights are always calculated and stored at full precision**. For maintaining calculation accuracy, m-LoRA framework mandates the use of full precision for calculations when accuracy is imperative.

For users with NVIDIA Ampere or newer GPU architectures, the `--tf32` option can be utilized to enable full-precision calculation acceleration.
